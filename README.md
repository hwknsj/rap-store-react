# Rap Store Inventory Manager (built with React.js)
By [Joel Hawkins](https://joel.fm)

## Demo
A demo is available on my website at [https://rap.joel.fm](https://rap.joel.fm).

## Installation
Clone the git repository, navigate to the folder, and run
```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage
After installation is complete, you should be able to run the store on your local machine using
```sh
yarn start
```

which should run on `localhost:3000`.

To build it to deploy on a server, run
```sh
yarn build
```

### Logic
You will be prompted to enter a Store Name. If the name you enter does not exist, it will be created. At this point it has *no owner*, so as soon as you login using Facebook, Github, or Twitter, you will be designated as the owner and no one else will be able to edit your store's inventory.

If you go to an existing store, for example "RapCaviar" (my creation), you can see the store but you **cannot edit it without authenticating**.

## Tools used

- React.js
- NPM / Yarn
- Stylus
- react-bootstrap
- Firebase (for authentication)
