    image: '/images/kendrick-damn.png',
    desc: 'Kendrick Lamar\'s 2017 album is a masterpiece of political commentary. His lyrical mastery delivers the message of a righteously despondent and angry post-Obama poet (and martyr) for his people; Lamar expertly dictates his story, and that of African Americans, with the virtuoso-flow of a Miles Davis instrumental solo. Lamar makes the listener understand the oppression from nearly every direction by rapping personal stories with genius rhythm & rhyme.',
